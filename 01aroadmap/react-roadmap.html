    <h1>React Roadmap</h1>
    <p>It is not good to become React Developer</p>
    <p>It is good to become JavaScript Developer</p>
    <p>It is very good to become Software Developer</p>
    <h2>Q1: Why to learn React</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>hype, job, trend, build UI (It is not good to say this in interview)</li>
        <li>make easy to manage complete front end (It is to say about React in interview)</li>
        <p>React is compiled to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, browser know HTML, CSS and JavaScript</p>
        <p>React can be used to build complex front end, clicking on a button update thing in multiple places</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>Q2: When should I learn React</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After mastering JavaScript 
            <ol>
                <li>(master JavaScript to learn any JS library like React) </li>
                <li>(Thread Execution, Execution Context, How function comes, how function goes to memory, DOM manipulation, Thread Execution, DOM Changing)</li>
                <li>(You should feel confident that you can do anything in JavaScript without React, but using React in can do it and make it simple )</li>
            </ol>
            <li>most project don't need react in initial phase</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Q3: Why React was created</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fantom (Ghost) message Problem (No Consistency in UI)</li>
        
        <p>It was created because of fantom (Ghost) message, chat icon show the number of user from whom you recieve messages, </p>
        <p>clicking on it show the list of user, and a count of message from each user, </p>
            <p>clicking on each customer message open chat center for chating, chat center could be open from chat icon at the top also</p>
            <p>Even After reading the message, the user count did not disapear</p>
            <p>After going to chat center directly, the user count and the message count from each user did not disapear either</p>
            <p>To solve this issue, React was created</p>
            
        </ul>
        <p>All State (Variable) manage by JavaScript to show or hide it in an application</p>
        <p>UI manage by DOM</p>
        <p>There should have been communication (Sync) between, But there was none. To solve this problem React came into being</p>
        <p>Dhan the lead react founding member sholve this issue after many update of react</p>
    <p>solving this problem was appretiated by internal team, but outside the team hated it at the begining</p>
    <p>React was adapted by Khan Academy and Unsplash</p>
    
    <h2>Q4: Don't learn React if</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You don't know how JS works OR DOM works</li>
        <li>How JavaScript internally works</li>
        <li>How Execution is done in single thread</li>
        <li>Waht is Global Context</li>
        <li>Waht is Execution Context</li>
        <li>Don't have knowledge of Bind, this, DOM</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>React Learning Process</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>go in-depth</li>
        <p>Learn about Babel, Fibre, Virtual DOM, diff algo, hydration</p>
        <li>By making Project (one topic at a time)</li>
        <p>Learn Todo, Calculator, Github API</p>
    </ul>

    <p>it is Working on Project then go indepth for each topic or Learn in depth then go for project</p>
    <p>we will follow the working on project way</p>

    <h2>React is a Library</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Framework</li>
        <p>Framework is like malitary</p>
        <p>As there are some role in framework, like specific naming convintion to be followed, location of file, ex: django, next</p>
        <li>Library</li>
        <p>Library is like cool dude</p>
        <p>we have freedom in library, it is smaller compare to framwork, concept is smaller, work can be done in many ways. ex React</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Topics to learn</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>core of React (State or UI manipulation, JSX)</li>
        <li>Component Reusability, which is simplar in react then php and others programming languages (using card, header, footer, button in multiple places)</li>
        <li>Reusing of Component (props), props or properties can be used or learned in components, properties or key values</li>
        <li>How to propagate change, it is done using hooks, learn few hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo), you will learn the remaining yourself</li>

    </ul>

    <p>What ever we have seen above, is all about React</p>

    <h2>Additional addon to React</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Router, React don't have Router, it is not React functionality, we have to use/install React-Router-DOM</li>
        <li>State management (React didn't have state management, it has it now)</li>        
        <p>Redux, Redux toolkit, zustand, Context API</p>
        <p>do state management, when it is required</p>
        
        <li>Class base component</li>
        <p>There are some legacy code, which run on class base component</p>
        
        <li>BAAS (Backend As A Service) App ex: Appwrite, Firebase, SuperBase ... </li>
        <p>Using BAAS we can create, social media clone, e-commerce app ...</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>After React</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>React is not a complete solution in most cases</li>
        <p>React is not a complete solution, and it does not have any intention to make it complete solution, as there is no seo (from seo perspective tags does not generate nicley, which can not be read correctly by search engine ), browser render issue for code written in react (React send code to browser, browser generate HTML and CSS, it seem slow for big application), no routing</p>
        <li>Framework</li>
        <p>Next Js, Gotsby, Remix</p>
    </ul>
