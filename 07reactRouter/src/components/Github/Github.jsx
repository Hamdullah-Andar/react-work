    // there is another optimaization which was used by NextJs, we have it in React Router too
    // this optimaization is used in <Route></Route> which is called loader 
    // when we want to fetch some data from the database we can directly fetch it inside the <Route></Route> too
    // at the result when we are about to load the Github component on the route where we have loader, the data gets fetch and it is kept in the cache too
    // Enen the data start fetching before the fetch inside useEffect of the component which loads

    // to load the data we have to import useLoaderData method from react-router-dom
    // Calling the useLoaderData return us the data we have fetched in githubInfoLoader and store it in data variable as above

    // And we have to pass githubInfoLoader to the <Route></Route> where we want to have the feature of fetching data when the Github componet is about to load

// Writing below function in a separate file is good practice
// We can write it here as well, and pass it to the <Route></Route> which call this (Github) component

export const githubInfoLoader = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/users/hamdullah-andar')
    // response is the promise returned by the fetch
    // we can directly return the promise 
    // As the response return from fetch is in Sting format, we can convert it to json() as below and return it
    return response.json()
}

// Note from AI about loader in <Route>

// ‚úÖ What you got right:
// loader={githubInfoLoader} runs before the <Github /> component renders.
// You can then grab the data in <Github /> using useLoaderData().
// Returning response.json() is correct since fetch returns a Response object, not the parsed data.
// This avoids redundant API calls inside the component and optimizes fetching.

// ‚ö° A couple of tweaks to your comments:
// Loader doesn‚Äôt fetch data ‚Äúon hover‚Äù ‚Äî it fetches when the route is about to load (preloading can happen if you use Link with React Router, but it‚Äôs not hover-specific).
// response.json() itself is already a promise, but React Router understands async loaders, so returning it works fine.
// üëâ So your concept is clear ‚Äî just adjust the ‚Äúhover‚Äù part and be precise that loader executes before rendering the component, not specifically on hover.

// updated the sentance of fetching data on hover when using loader in route
